## BTC: A Binary and Triangle Combined Descriptor for 3D Place Recognition

## Introduction
**BTC** is a novel global and local combined descriptor for 3D place recognition. To achieve viewpoint invariance, we devise a global triangle descriptor composed of three side lengths of a triangle formed by three keypoints extracted from the accumulated point cloud. The triangle descriptor inherently exhibits viewpoint invariance, as the side lengths remain unchanged regardless of viewpoint or direction. While the triangle descriptor captures the global appearance of the point cloud, to further enhance its descriptive and discriminative capabilities, we develop a local descriptor called the binary descriptor that encodes the local geometric information of each keypoint forming the triangle. This combination of global and local descriptors allows for accurate and robust place recognition, even in large-scale unstructured environments.

## Example

### Place Recognition
To perform place recognition using the BTC descriptor, you need to prepare the data and then launch the ROS node with the following command:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Prepare the submap LiDAR point cloud directories containing the point cloud files in either `.bin` or `.pcd` format.
   - File naming format should follow this convention:
     - For PCD files: `000000.pcd`, `000001.pcd`, ..., up to your maximum submap count.
     - For BIN files: similarly named as `000000.bin`, `000001.bin`, etc.
   - Prepare a `pose.txt` file with the following format:
     ```
     Submap_id pos_x pos_y pos_z quat_x quat_y quat_z quat_w
     ```
     where:
     - `Submap_id` is the identifier for the submap.
     - `pos_x`, `pos_y`, `pos_z` are the coordinates of the submap's position.
     - `quat_x`, `quat_y`, `quat_z`, `quat_w` are the quaternion components representing the orientation.

2. **Launch the Node**:
   Run the following command to start the place recognition process:

   ```bash
   roslaunch btc_desc place_recognition.launch
   ```
